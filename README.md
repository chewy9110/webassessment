JFSD web project 02

Title: JFSD web project 02
This is the first web development project using HTML and CSS esp on flexbox.

Description:
This project simulated the real-life scenario as a web developer. I was given a wireframe design from UX/UI designer to code using HTML and CSS.

●	What did you like about this project?

 I was able to practise my newly acquired skill in HTML and CSS esp flexbox to build from scratch the wireframe design concept into web page.

●	What did you struggle with in this project?

The translation of the wireframe design into actual webpage was a challenge. I was not as 'pixel-sharp' and so might have missed a few pixel alignment here and there. The process was laborious esp in testing the look between desktop and mobile layout. It also involved many trials and errors as I was not familiar with the properties and attributes of HTML and CSS.

●	What would make your experience with this assessment better?

If more time were given, it would be better for me to pause, troubleshoot and experiment with possible solutions and code tidiness. But nevertheless, it was a good kickstart into web development, skipping one night's sleep.
